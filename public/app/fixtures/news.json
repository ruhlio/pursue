      "body": "Hey guys,\n\nTo start this off, as you know, many of us were from STD, lest us not forget that.\nAnyway, I am happy to see things moving on as they are and with a new cracking team, set to hopefully do well in the Battlefield 3 eSports movement.\n\nThe positions in this clan are for things to run smoothly, and I have chosen to NOT HAVE an admin section, I feel the admin section in STD was all about bitching about members and crap, so I think we need to be a unity, united as one.\n\nThere is a MEMBERS ONLY SECTION which is only seen once your nickname has been given permission, this is where we will discuss everything within the clan - not for the public.\n\nThe positions that myself and Windslip hold are key to keeping the clan up - Server / Forum / Control. And for this being said, myself and Windslip would only like to be responsible for certain aspects of 'Team Pursue Gaming' - Be that, this website, this forum (with help), updates etc...\n\nWe have a Twitter account - Which I tend to control at the moment... I'm twitter mad (and my iPhone has 5 accounts easily switch-able). Nonetheless, we also have a YOUTUBE account and a FACEBOOK PAGE - these will hopefully help to get us noticed, the YOUTUBE = Everyone's, but I have to find out how I can allow for more than just 1 account being linked to it.\n\nDRDUCK - Will be leading the eSports side with JENS at his side.\n\nPLEASE DON'T HESITATE TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS AND PLEASE REMEMBER - We are a CLAN and to make this work, we ALL need to work together and get the balls rolling.\n\n100% PUNCTUALITY\n100% ATTENDANCE\n100% COURAGE\n= A GOOD WORKING CLAN.\n\nWELCOME TO 'PURSUE' eSports!"
